# Digikala-employee-net-promoter-score-analysis

This repository contains a selection of scripts designed to demonstrate expertise in data analysis using the **Python programming language**. The primary focus is on performing Net Promoter Score (NPS) analysis for HR department data from the Digikala company, illustrating the practical application of analytical techniques in a real-world business context.
I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to track employee loyalty and satisfaction by measuring their likelihood to recommend the Digikala company as an employer or its products. Utilized Python for data extraction and Power BI for data visualization, resulting in a 30% reduction in reporting time.
